<p>In this section, we will learn how to use Smile Shell, load data and save models,
    and visualize data in various ways. In the programming guide, we will mostly use
    the high level <a href="api/scala/index.html">Scala API</a> as it is concise and is easy to use. Note that all algorithms
    are implemented in Java and not all features and controls are exposed in Scala API.
    If you need more controls on the algorithm behaviors, please refer to the <a href="api/java/index.html">Java API</a>.</p>

<p>Smile comes with an interactive shell. In the home directory of Smile, type
    <pre><code>
        ./bin/smile
    </code></pre>
    to enter the shell, which is based on Scala interpreter. So you can run any valid Scala
    expressions in the shell. In the simplest case, you can use it as a calculator.
    Besides, all high-level Smile operators are predefined
    in the shell. Be default, the shell uses up to 4GB memory. If you need more memory
    to handle large data, use the option <code>-J-Xmx4096M</code>. For example,
    <pre><code>
        ./bin/smile -J-Xmx8192M
    </code></pre>
    You can also modify the configuration file <code>./conf/application.ini</code>
    for the memory and other JVM settings.</p>

<p>In the shell, type <code>:help</code> to print Scala interpreter help
    information. To get help information of Smile high-level operators,
    thpe <code>help</code>. You can also get detailed information on
    each operator by typing <code>help("command")</code>, e.g.
    <code>help("svm")</code>. To exit the shell, type <code>:quit</code>.</p>

<p>In the shell, type <code>demo</code> to bring up the demo window,
    which shows off various Smile's machine learning capabilities.</p>

<p>You can also type <code>benchmark()</code> to see Smile's performance
    on a couple of test data. You can run a particular benchmark by
    <code>bencharm("test name")</code>, where test name could be "airline",
    "usps", etc.</p>

<p>In the <code>data</code> directory, we also include many open datasets,
    which are frequently used in research and benchmark. Now let&#8217;s build
    a classification model with Smile. It is as easy as</p>
<pre><code>
    val data = readArff("data/weka/iris.arff", 4)<br/>
    val (x, y) = data.unzipInt<br/>
    <br/>
    val rf = randomForest(x, y)<br/>
    println(s"OOB error = ${rf.error}")<br/>
    rf.predict(x(0)) // or predict(rf, x(0))
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, we use the famous Iris data from R.A. Fisher. The data
    is in Weka's ARFF format. The second parameter of readArff is the column index
    of response variable. With our parsers, the column index starts with 0. The
    function readArff returns an object of <code>AttributeDataset</code>.
    Besides the data itself, an <code>AttributeDataset</code> object also contains many meta data.
    Then we use the help function <code>unzipInt</code> to get the training
    data and labels. For regression, you may use <code>unzipDouble</code> as
    the response variable is real value. Finally, we train a random forest
    with default parameters and print out its OOB (out of bag) error. We can apply
    the model on new data samples with the method <code>predict</code>.</p>
